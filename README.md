The STM32H735G-DK Discovery kit is used as a reference design for user application development before porting to the final product, thus simplifying the application development.

The full range of hardware features available on the board helps users to enhance their application development by an evaluation of all the peripherals (such as USB OTG FS, Ethernet, microSD™ card, USART, CAN FD, SAI audio DAC stereo with audio jack input and output, MEMS digital microphone, HyperRAM™, Octo‑SPI flash memory, RGB interface LCD with capacitive touch panel, and others). ARDUINO® Uno V3, Pmod™ and STMod+ connectors provide easy connection to extension shields or daughterboards for specific applications.

STLINK-V3E is integrated into the board, as the embedded in-circuit debugger and programmer for the STM32 MCU and USB Virtual COM port bridge.
